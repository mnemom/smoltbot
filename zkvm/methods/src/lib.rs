//! Build-time crate that compiles the guest ELF and exports IMAGE_ID.
//!
//! The `include!` macro pulls in constants generated by `risc0-build`
//! during the build step. The key exports are `AIP_ZKVM_GUEST_ELF` (the
//! compiled RISC-V binary) and `AIP_ZKVM_GUEST_ID` (the image ID used
//! for proof verification). Names are derived from the guest package name
//! `aip-zkvm-guest`.
